    <p> 
        To my partner-in-crime, my confidant, and my sunshine on cloudy days — <br>
        I’m so lucky to have you in my life. <br>
        Cheers to another year of laughter, memories, and friendship.<br>
        Happy Birthday!<br>
        
        You bring so much light into the lives of everyone around you, and I hope today reminds you just how loved, appreciated, and celebrated you truly are.<br>
        Your kindness, strength, and sense of humor are unmatched — and I honestly don’t know what I’d do without you.<br>
        
        May this year bless you with new adventures, beautiful surprises, and everything your heart desires.<br>
        Here’s to growing, glowing, and making every moment count — together.<br>
        
        Let’s make this birthday unforgettable.<br>
        With all my love,<br>
        Siya
